        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hello, my name is Alexandre, I am 22 years old, and I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, capital. I have been married for a year and a half and I am living the best phase of my life. 
            My parents raised me in a strict way and with much love, but that doesn't mean that things were easy, I lost my father very young when I was only 9 years old, and at 15 I was already working to help at home, I always follow the example that my mother gave me of "Always strive to achieve what you want", and so I follow, striving and winning many things. 
            During my 15 to 18 years of age, I worked as a pamphlet delivery person, truck driver assistant, and dental prosthesis delivery person, and during this time I didn't leave school aside, and kept going until the end. 
            When I turned 18, God blessed me with a CLT job with a fixed salary, I was very happy, my first record in my wallet, my first experience as a production assistant in a metallurgical company, and during the time I worked there, I got my driver's license and my first motorcycle. 
            But with the arrival of the pandemic the company declared bankruptcy and I was fired, and in 2020 I began to study for the area that I always wanted to exercise, Analysis and systems development, during this period I could not stand still without working, the college bills would start to arrive, and I went to work as a courier, even with all the risk of getting the COVID-19 I needed to take food into the house and pay the bills, and once again God protected me against all dangers, and keep me during a pandemic. 
            And on 06/04/2021 I got a job as an IT Technician, where I worked giving N2 support and performing various tasks in Oracle database, but decided to ask for accounts and close this cycle on 01/01/2023. 
            And today I am graduated from college and looking for a place in the job market as a Developer, even after finishing college I keep taking courses in programming and English, aiming for a position to be able to put everything I learned in practice, and have my experience in the area I always dreamed of being. 
            Finally, I am a person who is always looking to improve, I like to have clear and objective goals, I love to be challenged because I usually see them as an opportunity and learning. 
            I am not perfect, but with each achievement I grow.
